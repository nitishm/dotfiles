  shortDescription: Start a remote packet capture on pods using tcpdump and wireshark
  caveats: |
    This plugin needs the following programs:
    * wireshark (optional, used for live capture)
  description: |
    When working with micro-services, many times it's very helpful to get a capture of the network
    activity between your micro-service and it's dependencies.

    ksniff use kubectl to upload a statically compiled tcpdump binary to your pod and redirecting it's
    output to your local Wireshark for smooth network debugging experience.
