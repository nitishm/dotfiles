  shortDescription: >- 
    An exec multiplexer using Tmux
  homepage: https://github.com/predatorray/kubectl-tmux-exec
  caveats: |
    This plugin needs the following programs:
    * tmux(1)
    * gnu-getopt(1)

    Since the `getopt` in GNU-Linux is by default the GNU's one,
    it is not required to install `gnu-getopt` again.

    But, if you are using Mac, please follow the instruction below.
    1. `brew install gnu-getopt`, or download it from its website
       and install it manually.
    2. Either add `export GNU_GETOPT_PREFIX="$(brew --prefix gnu-getopt)"`
       to your profile file, which is RECOMMENDED.
       Or, replace the `getopt` with `gnu-getopt` by adding it to
       the head of `$PATH` env, like
       `export PATH="$(brew --prefix gnu-getopt)/bin:$PATH"`.

    This plugin uses Tmux to multiplex commands to pods.
    Instead of `exec bash` into multiple pod's containers one-at-a-time,
    you can now do it at the same time by opening multiple panes in a window.
    Run 'kubectl tmux-exec --help' for more information on the plugin.
