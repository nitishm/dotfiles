  shortDescription: Find and debug Pods that are "Not Ready"
  description: |
    This plugin finds and displays debugging information for Pods
    that are "Not Ready" in the current namespace.
    Pods are deemed as "Not Ready" if they have any failing Pod Conditions
    or have any containers that do not have a "Ready" value.
    In addition, you can filter which pods you want to show based on labels
    or field selectors (as well as by pod name(s)).
